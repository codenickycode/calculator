[Order of Operations Calculator](https://drumnickydrum-calculator.netlify.app/) allows the user to build expressions of any length then evaluate at once.  

The UI is built with React, the input/evaluation logic in vanilla JS.

I built this to practice algorithm design as well as responsive web design using a front-end framework.
